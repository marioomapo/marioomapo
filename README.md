- 👋 Hi, I’m Mário Apolinário, and I am MSc Electrical Engineer with emphasis on Power Electronics, and Technologist in Industrial Mechatronics. I have a great appreciation for Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems and Power Converters, areas in which I work directly, thus accumulating experience in the design, development and commissioning of these systems. I have expertise in the areas of Industrial Automation, Instrumentation, Industrial Electronic Maintenance, Renewable Energy, Electrical Machine, Electric Drives and Electric Vehicle. I always liked programmation languages, I have been programming in low level languages like VHDL and C for DSPIC and ARM, and now I have the chance to migrate for other areas like IA, Data Base, and Internet application, areas that I have interest to learn much more. I am looking for an opportunity to add value, excellence and competence to the company in a competitive market environment and dynamic.
